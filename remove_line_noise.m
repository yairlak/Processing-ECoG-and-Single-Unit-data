function denoised = remove_line_noise(s,fline,fs,winw)
% remove_line_noise(s,fline,fs,winw) removes 50Hz/60Hz line noise from a signal s sampled in
% frequency fs (default 1024Hz) by filtering out windowed sine waves 
% of the line frequency fline (default 50Hz) and of its harmonics.
% -- s is of size Ns x Nc, with Ns time samples in Nc channels. 
% --fline - line frequency [Hz]
% -- fs - sampling rate [Hz]
% -- winw is the filter window width [sec] (default 1sec). The wider it is, the more
% the filter ignores transient fluctuations and looks for consistant
% oscillations. 
% If s is a matrix, remove_line_noise(s) treats the columns of s as vectors
% i.e: time points = rows, channels=columns
